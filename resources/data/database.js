Ban Gioc is the most majestic and beautiful waterfall of Vietnam, located in Dam Thuy commune, Trung Khanh district,
Cao Bang. Right from afar, tourists can hear the rushing waterfall. From a height of over 30 m, large bodies of water
flow through many limestone steps. In the middle of the waterfall, there was a large rock tissue covered with trees,
which saw the water split into 3 streams like three white silk bands.<br>
Day and night, the waterfall rolls down on flat rocks, sending out countless white dust particles that cover a large area.
On sunny days, the steam also creates a shimmering rainbow. At the foot of Ban Gioc waterfall is a wide, mirror-like
surface of the river. The two banks are grass, green forest flap.<br>
